Welcome to polynomial documentation! 


There are some rules about using menager here:

1.Polinome input:
The normal polinome looks like this: x^2+2x+1
All variables are one-letter ab = a*b
Mistakes:
	-Nums after varibles: a34
	-Varibles in degree: a^dc
	-Leading nulls: 00x
	-Use incomprehensible simbols: 1! , @#$%&*() etc.
2.Buttons:
All buttons do what they say!
I beg you, read the dialog boxes and enter the correct data.
